        There are some types that cannot be used as the type of an array. These types include System.TypedReference and System.ArgIterator. The type of an array can't be a static class, because instances of a static class can't be created.

        You can declare arrays as implicitly typed local variables. The array must be initialized using a new expression. In addition, all elements in an array initializer must have a best common type. The following examples show how to declare an implicitly typed array:
