    <h1>HTML Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
        HTML is not a programming Language,it is a tag based language.
        HTML dose not supports user defined tags, it supports only predefined tags.
        HTML is not a case senstive.
        HTML is a platform independent.

    <h1>Websites</h1>
    <p>
        Collection of web pages called as website. Websites classified into 2 types:
    </p>
    <h2>1.Static website</h2>
    <p>
        Static web pages are made of “fixed code,” and unless the site developer makes changes, nothing will change on the page. Think of it like a brochure for a business. Static sites give a lot of the same type of information that you could get from a brochure, but it can’t just change itself.
    </p>
    <h2>2.Dynamic website</h2>
    <p>
        There’s a simple way to determine if a site is dynamic. If you can interact with it, it’s a dynamic site. For example, dynamic sites allow you to create a user profile, comment on a post, or make a reservation.

    <h1>HTML Document</h1>
    <p>
        The "!DOCTYPE html" declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.
        The "html" element is the root element of an HTML page.
        The "head" element contains meta information about the HTML page
        The "title" element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
        The "body" element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
        The "h1" element defines a large heading
        The "p" element defines a paragraph
    </p>
    <div style="background-color:lightgreen">
        <h1>Division Tag(div)</h1>
        <p>
            The "div" tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
            The "div" tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
            The "div" tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
            Any sort of content can be put inside the "div"tag!
            Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the "div" element.
